## About

**Wabbajack Autodownload** automates downloading a [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) modlist *without* a premium Nexus account.

## Motivation

Without a premium Nexus account, you have to manually click on a download button every time a new mod is added to the queue. Since modlists often have hundreds of mods, this is time consuming. Wabbajack Autodownload is a macro automates clicking on the download button for you.
